## Description
This repo contains my personal website.

It is built to run on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and to be hosted on GitHub pages.

## Project Structure
- This project uses the same directory structure as most Jekyll projects.

## Development
- A PR to `staging` will automatically build the page.
- A successful merge to `staging` will move the content in `_rooticons` to the root directory.
