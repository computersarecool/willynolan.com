    - p: 'It was nearly impossible to work at <a href="https://www.msg.com/obscura-digital" class="nobreak">Obscura 
Digital</a> and not work on architectural projection mapping at some point.'

    - p: 'Out of all the great projection _projects I worked on there, this spur of the moment event at <a href="http://english.stu.edu.cn/index.php" class="nobreak">Shantou 
University</a> in Shantou, Guangdong, China was particularly memorable because of the unique building facade and the 
compressed production timeline.'

  -
    - p: 'While visiting the university to work on a different, 
<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/30113999/Shantou-University-Graduation">unrelated projection mapping project</a>, 
we were asked to do an architectural projection show on the newly completed campus medical building.'

    - p: 'The initial request came approximately 24 hours before the show was supposed to happen (at least that was 
when I first heard about it).'

    - p: "There was only one day to prepare content, set up the projectors and create the show but the building's
unique shape made the proposal hard to resist."

  -
    - p: The scheduling constraints meant there was no photographer scheduled to capture the job was almost not documented at all.

    - p: 'Luckily some students at the university were taking a drone photography class nearby and captured footage of 
the event which they were happy to share in exchange for a presentation on how to projection map buildings.'

    - p: The video in this post is mostly made from footage students at Shantou University filmed.
