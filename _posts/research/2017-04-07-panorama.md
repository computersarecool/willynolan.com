sections:
  -
    - p: 'Creating a panorama can be seen as the combination of many different computational photography techniques.'

    - p: 'Depending on the situation warping, blending, and corner detection may all be used.'

    - p: 'There are many tools that create very nice panoramas but looking at the process at each step can be quite 
illuminating.'

    - p: 'This research resulted in a program that makes panoramas by finding a homography between the input images, warping
them into alignment, performing a multi-frequency blend and then an automated cropping.'

  -
    - p: 'First the corners of all the input images need to be found.  Then matches between the two images need to be located. 
In this project, the OpenCV <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d3/da1/classcv_1_1BFMatcher.html">Brute Force Matcher</a> 
was used to find matches between the images.'

    - p: 'Once there is a list of the matching features between the images a homography can be found that connects the images. 
At this point, the “canvases” of the input image can be warped so that they align.'
    
  -
    - p: "The second featured image shows an outline of how the three images canvases (shown in purple, green and pink)
were warped after finding matching points."

    - p: 'After warping the images can be stitched and blended through a variety of ways. This project used
