sections:
  -
    - p: 'There are many screens in AT&T Stadium. There are two rows of "ribbon" screens surrounding the stadium 
bowl, the "Diamond Vision" in the center of the field (ðŸ’Ž) and the "AT&T LiveFX" board.'

    - p: 'Usually different content plays on all the various screens but, during certain "takeover" moments, immersive 
content plays across each of these screens.'

  -
    - p: "From a design perspective, this project's main challenge was to create a user interface familiar enough to
stadium personnel that they would feel comfortable enough to takeover all the screens in the stadium with the press of 
a button."

  -
    - p: 'In addition to writing the show control software, I got the great opportunity to evaluate my programming 
<i>in situ</i> while serving as its operator on a several occasions.'

    - p: During the takeover moments the director would call out which video to play with an emphatic countdown.

    - p: My narration in the video at the end of this post is a much slower (and less enthusiastic) interpretation of his very epic announcing style.
