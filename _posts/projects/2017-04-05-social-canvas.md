    - p: "Social Canvas is probably the world's largest multiplayer game installation.  It functions like most 
tile-matching video games except on a much, much larger scale. It was created in 2018 and installed at the MGM Cotai in 
Macau."

  -
    - p: 'Visitors to MGM Cotai can quickly join the game by scanning a QR code and submit entries by sending 
messages to a dedicated WeChat channel.'

    - p: 'These entries are then displayed in “The Spectacle”, MGM’s term for the world’s largest area of permanent 
indoor LED screens that makes up their lobby and casino entrance.'

  -
    - p: 'In addition to the scale of this installation it is also unique in that it is truly interactive. Guests are 
allowed to directly participate in the game, creating a shared experience for all.' 

    - p: 'MGM''s write up is <a href="https://www.mgm.mo/en/cotai/art/art-tour/collaboration/social-canvas">here</a>. 
The featured videos show an overview of the project and a demo of the project in action.'
