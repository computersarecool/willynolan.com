    - p: It is the year 04000 CE.

    - p: A group of dancing astronauts has been lost in space for the last eight years searching for their home planet of Cydonia.

    - p: With nothing else to do besides explore outer space and listen to the hottest Nu-disco cuts, this team of explorers might just find their long-lost home..."

    - p: ...At least that's what the backstory is.

  -
    - p: This unique audiovisual performance, which took place in San Francisco, transformed the crowd into the crew of a digital spaceship in search of Cydonia.

    - p: Twelve Android tablets and custom software simultaneously operated as the audiovisual controllers and the display surface.

  -
    - p: 'In an effort to promote interactivity, new crew members (i.e. anyone attending the event) were encouraged to 
adjust the music, visuals and explore outer space via the tablet interface that was custom-made for this project.'

    - p: The featured images show concept design as well as some user interface designs and the video shows some footage from the event.
